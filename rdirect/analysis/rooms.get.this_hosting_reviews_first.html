                        The good: apartment is quite nice! Comfy beds! Usable kitchen! Very thoughtfully equipped- down to an umbrella! A big step above other furnished vacation rentals I have stayed at. Convenient location too.

Drawbacks: 3rd ave is where lots of buses run, and lots of people noise too. Could be a problem in the summer with windows open-- we stayed there in December, so we'd just whine about the rain, which is probably not Sally &amp; Darik's fault.
I suggest you ask to see the rental agreement before you commit. The one they sent me said no one who wasn't a guest could come in =&gt; no dinner guests?! even though the cooking facilities were one of the attractive points!? Also they wanted my ccard info even though airbnb already had it. They are advertising this place through at least one other venue so maybe they use the same paperwork for all, but it made me uncomfortable.

                        The apartment is as pictured which is great, it is clean, neat, tidy and had good amenities. Overall our experience was a good one and i can recommend it. The area is close enough to the downtown, about 0.5km to the markets and action, probably easier to get a taxi or bus if you want to go frequently. The parking is good but watch out for the allyway being blocked by other vehicles which did happen to us a couple of times.
I did have trouble contacting the host Derek and I just kept getting his answering service so make sure you have your contact details worked. Apart from these minor issues the place was good.
Neighbourhood is OK but if I was a woman I wouldnt be walking around at night.

                        We had a great stay at the Urban Oasis.  The location couldn't have been better.  We were within walking distance of all the major attractions in the downtown area plus the condo is right on a major bus corridor.  Bell town was a fun neighborhood with lots of places to eat etc.  We loved the full kitchen and had a great stay.  Hope to use it again someday!

                        Though I didn't get to meet Sally or Darik we spoke via email many times prior to the reservation and they were both very professional and understanding with my constantly changing plans.

The apartment is spotless and had all the amenities one could want from the washer and dryer to the shampoo, conditioner, and hair dryer.

We didn't take advantage of the free parking spot but thought it would be worth mentioning.  A completely seamless and lovely stay in Seattle- seize your opportunity to stay here!

                        The place is absolutely beautiful and worked out much better than getting 2 hotel rooms. We loved the ability to walk down to the market, buy some fresh fish and veggies and make our own meals in the well stocked kitchen. Belltown is a great area and 1st street (2 blocks away) had a fun nightlife scene, but just outside of the building can get a bit sketchy at night. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this unit to anyone who is looking to see Seattle by foot and wants the conveniences of a home.

                        We had a great time in Urban Oasis 2-bedroom. Plenty of room for sleeping and relaxing . . . and not in the same room. The best part? We walked everywhere! Close to the Market and the Sculpture Garden. And all sorts of food options right around the corner. The only downside was the night noise. Otherwise, a great trip.
